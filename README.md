**A tool to download prism launcher modlists (*modrinth only for now*)**

As of now, it only functions with modrinth and PrismLauncher, this was created for some of my friends who are less computer literate to make it easier to play minecraft packs we made together, not intended for people to use this, but I like having a github repo, do whatever you want with it and leave criticism since I am a fresh dev who started learning CS recently!
